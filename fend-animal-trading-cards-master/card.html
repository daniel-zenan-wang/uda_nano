			<p>Spirited and athletic, yet steady and dependable, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a true "big dog on short legs."
				Herding, obedience, agility, or chasing balls (with surprising speed) are enjoyable outlets (both physical and mental) for his enthusiasm and desire to work.
				If his days include such moderate exercise, along with the loving companionship of his family, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is adaptable and easy to live with.
				He is polite with guests, reserved with strangers, and makes a sensible watchdog.
